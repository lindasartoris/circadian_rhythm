# circadian_rhythm
## the effect of circadian rhythm on organisational immunity

The scripts in this repostitory were originally created by **Nathalie Stroeymeyt** & [**Adriano Wanderlingh**](https://github.com/AdrianoWanderlingh/Ant_Tracking)

With additional contributions from **Daniel Schl√§ppi** (in I: "vital_Linda.R") & **Luke Leckie** (in I: "4_CLONING_CAPSULES_Linda.R")

The experiment and the data processing were performed at the [**Ant Epidemiology Lab**](https://stroeymeyt-lab.co.uk/), Bristol, and made possible by the support of the entire AEL team

With their guidance I adapted the scripts such that they'd work for my experiment
