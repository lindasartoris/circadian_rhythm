# circadian_rhythm
## effect of circadian rhythm on organisational immunity

The scripts in this repostitory were created by **Nathalie Stroeymeyt** & [**Adriano Wanderlingh**](https://github.com/AdrianoWanderlingh/Ant_Tracking)

With contribution from **Daniel Schl√§ppi** (in I: "vital_Linda.R") & **Luke Leckie** (in I: "4_CLONING_CAPSULES_Linda.R")

With their support I made minor changes to the scripts to make them work for my experimental conditions

### I_changes to myrmidon files
Manual and automated steps to create myrmidon files containing all relevant metadata (tag orientation, death, treated workers, etc.), capsules (all interactions & grooming) & zones (nest & arena)

### II_EXP1_base_analysis
Base analysis script to calculate interactions, trajectories and extract colony metadata

### III_Social_Network_Plasticity_Exp_2022_LS
Post processing steps to randomise interactions, simulate transmissions, analyse network properties & summarise interactions
